## Discussion and Workshop Questions

**Clarity Checkpoint:** Where do you most often lose clarity in your prompts: Context, Role, Action, Format, or Tone? What patterns do you notice?

**Constraint Testing:** Which constraint technique (word limits, reading level, specific inclusions/exclusions) improved your AI output the most this week?

**Action Verb Challenge:** Convert one "tell me about..." prompt into a strong action verb prompt (analyze, synthesize, draft, evaluate). Document what changed in the quality of response.

**Reverse Engineering:** Take a recent AI output and create a "reverse outline." What would you move, cut, or enhance?

**Template Building:** Choose one technique from the book (examples, constraints, chain-of-thought, or persona) and design a repeatable template for your specific role or industry.

**Prompt Engineering** - The systematic approach to crafting instructions that consistently produce high-quality, relevant AI responses.

**Context Window** - The amount of information (measured in tokens) that an AI model can process and remember within a single conversation.

**Chain-of-Thought** - A prompting technique that asks AI to show its reasoning process step-by-step before providing the final answer.

**Few-Shot Prompting** - Including 1-3 examples in your prompt to demonstrate the desired output format and quality.

## Troubleshooting Guide

**Generic or bland responses?** Rebuild using the Five Pillars framework. Replace vague language with specific terms. Add concrete examples of desired output.

**AI seems confused or off-topic?** Check your Context and Role clarity. Break complex requests into smaller, sequential prompts.

**Inconsistent output quality?** Create templates for repeated tasks. Use the same successful prompt structure across similar projects.

**Getting stuck in conversation loops?** Start a fresh session or provide a clear summary to refocus the AI on your main objective.
